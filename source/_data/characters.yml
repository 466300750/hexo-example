    Meredith Palmer is the promiscuous Supplier Relations Manager. She has been divorced twice and has two kids. She is an alcoholic and often comes to work hung over, complaining that people talk too loudly in the morning and the lights are too bright. In “Business Ethics” she reveals she’s been sleeping with a paper supplier rep to get better pricing and she had a sex pact with a former co-worker.

    She isn’t shy when it comes to Jim and has no regard for tact in “Launch Party” when she wants him to sign her pelvic cast, making Jim visible uncomfortable when she lifts up her clothes to reveal the cast.

    Meredith has a son, Jake, who was first seen in “Take Your Daughter to Work” and who eventually grows up to be a stripper. Her alcoholism gets the better of her in “Moroccan Christmas” when she drunkenly set her hair on fire prompting Michael to stage an intervention.

    Andy moved to Pennsylvania to work for Dunder Mifflin Scranton after the Stamford branch closed. He immediately begins sucking up to Michael much to the annoyance of his new co-workers.

    He comes across as a rich, spoiled, entitled frat boy type who never passed up a chance to brag about his Alma Mater, Cornell. But the “Nard Dog” has a temper which results in Michael sending him to anger management in “The Return” but he never lets it interrupt his a capella practice.

    Due to his insecurity, he often displays selfish and arrogant behavior. He develops a few romantic rivalries with his co-workers including Dwight and Gabe. He duals Dwight over Angela which results in both breaking ties with her.

    Andy general irritates his co-workers and tends to overestimate his relationships with others so much so that Michael takes to hiding in his office to avoid him. Most of Andy’s problems come from just wanting to be liked by those around him.

    Jim Halpert was the everyman of Dunder Mifflin. He worked just hard enough not to get fired but not so hard that he stood out.  When not making sales calls he passed the time by pulling pranks on his deskmate Dwight. Jim defined the “slacker, and proud of it” attitude. At first, he had no passion for his job, even being reluctant to call it a career.

    As the series progressed he showed more ambition by applying for a promotion in the episode “The Meeting” and even more so in the last season by starting a business with a friend. His willingness to work hard was driven by his want to provide for his family. After longing for the receptionist for years he finally started a relationship, and eventually a family, with Pam.

    Jim’s defining moment came when, on a whim, he married Pam on the Maid of the Mist at Niagara Falls. Holding Pam, Jim smiles at her and then at the camera, finally realizing that he has everything he’s ever wanted.

    Explaining why Michael is the best character on the office is like explaining why you need more than just snakes and sparklers for your firework stand. Giving Michael Scott his own personal camera crew must have been his dream come true.

    Michael lived to entertain, from hosting the Dundies, to creating not so helpful orientation videos. Michael treated every day of work at Dunder Mifflin as a gift and opportunity to entertain and be loved by his employees. In the end it worked for him when he started a life with Holly in Colorado.

    Everyone was sad to see Michael leave but remember him for the times they made them smile. He was the heart of the show for seven years and nothing was quite the same after he left. Michael’s best moments range from the ridiculous, like cooking his foot on a George Foreman Grill to incredibly heartfelt like his talk with Jim on the booze cruise about never giving up.

    There are so many reasons why Michael was the best which was why this entry was so hard….that’s what she said.

    As Assistant to the Regional Manager, this Amish beet farmer never missed an opportunity to exert his imagined power. Dwight started off as just another suck up who thought he was more important than he was. There is a Dwight in every work place. Dwight was Michael’s right hand man for most of the show so it was hard to imagine how he would function after Michael moved to Colorado, but he did his best to carry on.

    Despite being the best salesman in the company, Dwight always let Jim and his pranks get the better of him. He did everything in his power to get Jim fired when he was promoted over Dwight in “The Promotion.” Pranks aside, it was fun to see how great they worked as a sales team in “Traveling Salesmen.” We got to see his sensitive side as he comforted a crying Pam. Our hearts broke for Dwight to see him crying in the stairwell in “Money.”

    The only thing Dwight loved more than Dunder Mifflin was Angela. Even though their romantic arc was chaotic, it was clear they were made for each other eventually having a child together and getting married in the last episode.

    Pam Beasley was the receptionist for Dunder Mifflin. She started the show engaged to Roy who worked in the warehouse. Pam struggled with her feelings for Jim through the first few seasons but time would see them become a couple, get married, and start a family together.  

    She was the voice of reason in the office. Most of the time she found herself exasperated trying to temper Michael’s personality. Pam was usually the recipient of Michael’s suggestive but harmless remarks. There was brief rift between them when Michael started dating Pam’s mom but the two reconciled after she slapped him.

    Pam often felt stuck but tried to break out of rut on a few occasions. She attended design school and even boldly quit her job in the episode “Two Weeks” to help Michael start the Michael Scott Paper Company. She wanted more than to be a receptionist and became the first salesperson for the Michael Scott Paper Company, but when the company was bought out she returned to Dunder Mifflin as a salesperson.

    Pam grew from meek and passive to strong and assertive. If Michael was the heart, Pam was the backbone.

    Angela Martin is the cold-hearted head of accounting. A petite woman, she views her co-workers mostly as distractions. Angela is definitely not out to make friends. Often she shows open disdain for her co-workers, especially Kevin and Meredith. 

    Angela is all business and is not above tattling. In “The Coup” she exposes Movie Monday to Jan which gets Michael in trouble but this backfires and Angela fears the Branch might be shut down. Despite her conservative views, she carries on a secret affair with Dwight. Their relationship goes smoothly until “Fun Run” when Dwight mercy kills her cat.

    She then starts dating Andy if only to make Dwight jealous, and even gets engaged, but in the end, she realizes Dwight is her soulmate and they get married in the series finale.

Creed keeps to himself but it is revealed that he has a rather dark side to him.

    During one Christmas party he asks what kind of gift Santa would bring if he had done something truly evil. He is a terrible employee. He forgets his job in “Goodbye Toby” and gets a paper mill employee fired after he blew off an inspection. He spends most of his time playing solitaire on his computer and manipulates Michael into firing Devon in “Halloween.”

    Despite this, Creed is usually in a cheery mood and likes his co-workers, it’s just that most of them don’t like them, especially Ryan who thinks he has an “old man smell.”

    Stanley Hudson is actually one of the hardest workers in the office, even if he does start to gather his things a few minutes before his day is officially over. He was usually seen on the phone with customers and has been with Dunder Mifflin for more than 10 years. He could be more personable though since he likes to keep his distance from his co-workers, even Phyllis his deskmate.

    Being African-American, Michael stereotypes Stanley by referring to him as “urban” and “coming from the streets” and assumes he’ll be a great basketball player when the office plays the warehouse guys in a pickup game, but he’s terrible.

    He knows Michael means no malice and often dismisses him. Stanley doesn’t like to get involved in office antics and often comes across grumpy and impatient. Stanley berated a terrified Ryan who thought he was flirting with his middle school aged daughter in “Take Your Daughter to Work Day” and asks him if he’s “lost his damn mind, because he’ll help him find it.”

    He has lost his temper more than once and lashed at Michael in “Did I Stutter?” and smashed Michael’s car in “Gossip” after he exposed Stanley’s affair. Stanley looks to retire soon but always looks forward to the Scranton Business Park annual pretzel day.

    Kevin Malone was an accountant for Dunder Mifflin and was portrayed as a dull, slow-witted, man-child. Kevin enjoys the simple things in life-like sports and candy and even keeps a jar of M&Ms at his desk. He likes to gamble and mentions in “Casino Night” he won a gold bracelet at the World Series of Poker and he has a world famous chili recipe, but sometimes he drops it before it can be eaten.

    In “Safety Training” he and Jim start betting on various things around the office. Kevin plays drums in a Police cover band called Scrantonicity and played Phyllis’ wedding. Angela and Oscar are Kevin’s co-workers in accounting and while he gets along with Oscar, Angela views him as dumb and disgusting.

    She’s not necessarily wrong though because he does have trouble reciting the Pledge of Allegiance in “Dwight K. Schrute, Acting Manager” and Holly mistook him for being mentally challenged. Kevin’s life ambition is to lie on the beach and eat hot dogs, which is something we can all relate to.

    Ryan is the newest addition to Dunder Mifflin as the temp in Season 1 and witnesses Michael’s inappropriate sense of humor when he fake fires Pam, leaving her in tears. Michael lavishes Ryan with unwanted attention and has a severe mancrush on him, but Ryan finds Michael annoying and does his best to ignore him, unless it benefits him.

    When Ryan begins dating Kelly, he again finds himself receiving unwanted affection and attention. Ryan is cocky, arrogant, and desperately trying to prove how smart he is. Season 4 sees him promoted to Jan’s old position and he becomes Michael’s boss, but that didn’t last long because he’s arrested for fraud and is fired from the company.

    He had to work in a bowling alley until Michael offered him a job with the Michael Scott paper company. Later, he rejoins Dunder Mifflin as a temp in “Weight Loss” and he gets some good hazing. After Season 5 his personality seems to change from episode to episode from bow tie wearing hipster to scarf wearing poet. No one, including Michael, take him seriously anymore.

    Phyllis Vance is a soft-spoken, but friendly Sales Rep for Dunder Mifflin. Portrayed as somewhat meek, she proves to be a savvy sales woman. But she’s a hard worker who won the Dundie for busiest beaver, although there was a typo on the trophy.

    Michael often ridicules Phyllis for being old even though they were in the same high school class. Michael may do this to keep him from thinking about how old he is getting. Phyllis marries Bob Vance in Season 3 and hints that they have a rather feisty relationship.

    Like Stanley, she prefers to stay out of office conflicts. She has a very sweet disposition but when pushed she can be very conniving like when she blackmailed Angela in Season 5 after catching her cheating on Andy with Dwight. She takes her place as head of the party planning committee and she enjoys pushing Angela around.

    Phyllis plays to Michael’s ego by putting him in her wedding and therefore getting a six-week vacation for her honeymoon even though he did his best to ruin every precious moment.

    Toby is the sad sack human resources rep. Technically, he is a corporate employee which leads to Michael viewing him as the enemy and he thinks Toby’s job is to “make everything lame.” Michael’s mission in life is making life miserable for Toby and in a fitting first appearance in “Diversity Day” Michael kicks Toby out of a meeting, just because he can.

    Toby endures Michael’s abuse throughout the show which results in Toby going out of his way to avoid Michael. But Michael tried to get rid of him for good by planting what he thought was marijuana in his desk, but it was only a caprese salad.

    Even though Michael hates him, Toby gets along well with his other co-workers. He and Jim used to sit by each other but Michael separated them for talking too much, but it’s a good thing because he’s obsessed with Pam.

    In “The Negotiation” Darryl invites Toby to stay at his cousin’s house during a trip to corporate but denies Michael the same courtesy. Despite Michael’s hatred, Toby’s position as HR rep means that he occasionally has to advocate for Michael much to his reluctance.

Michael accidentally outs Oscar in “Gay Witch Hunt” before trying to apologize and show the office he is okay with Oscar being gay by forcing Oscar to kiss him. To avoid a lawsuit, Jan gives Oscar a settlement and a paid vacation.

    Like Pam, Oscar tries to be the voice of reason in the office and puts up with Michael’s antics while enduring off-color jokes for being gay and being Mexican. He often tries to rally people to see reason like in “The Surplus” he tried to convince his co-workers to vote for a new copier and in “Prince Paper” he gives a speech stating why he doesn’t think Hilary Swank is hot.

    She endures a tumultuous, one-sided relationship with Ryan. She dreams of getting married and having babies after their first date. Ryan breaks up with her to take a job in corporate. She then begins to date Darryl from the warehouse but this relationship also seems to be one-sided and she has the emotional maturity of a 13-year-old.

    In “Business Trip” she send a break up text to Darryl who is shown to be more than happy. Despite her naive personality she can be quite vindictive if she doesn’t get her way. She loves fashion shows at lunch and she’s not afraid about trying radical dieting methods like a tapeworm in an effort to lose weight.

In “Boys and Girls” Michael nearly destroys the warehouse and leaves Darryl to clean it up.

    In “Safety Training” Darryl loses his patience with Michael during a safety demonstration because Michael disregards rules and safety, but he gets along with most everyone except Michael. He and Jim are close and he bonds with Toby since they are both single parents.

    Darryl gets promoted in “St. Patrick’s Day” and takes a position in the office and then struggles to relate to his former blue-collar workers but shows business savvy and he goes into business with Jim late in the series. He is just a cool and calm dude who enjoys playing the keyboard.

    Gabe Lewis takes over as Michael’s supervisor in “Sabre” where Dunder Mifflin was bought out by a printer manufacturer. Even though his is a corporate employee, he has no real power in the Scranton branch. The Dunder Mifflin employees know they don’t have to listen to him and don’t respect him.

    He works directly for Sabre CEO Jo Bennett and seems to have given up hope of ever having a normal life due to the long hours and frequent travel Jo demands of him.

    In “St. Patrick’s Day” he mentions that he goes to Amsterdam seven times a year, presumably to take advantage of legalized drugs and prostitution. He does start a relationship with Erin but she only agrees to go out with him out of obligation because he is her boss. Jo doesn’t doesn’t treat Gabe well either, making him walk her dogs, which further contributes to his lack of self-worth.

    David Wallace is Dunder Mifflin’s CEO. He is calm, smart, and professional. He tends to show more patience with Michael, certainly more than Jan. He is based out of the New York office and does not get directly involved in Michael’s antics as much as Jan though.

    He is introduced in “Valentine’s Day” where instead of presenting branch financial stats, Michael shows a tribute video set to U2’s With or Without You. David politely asks him for the financial numbers which Michael produces.

    David often has to deal with phone calls with urgent messages so Michael can get a call back for his always petty questions or ideas. When Michael interviews for that job, he doesn’t get it, but David thinks Michael is a nice guy,  as we learn in “The Deposition” he doesn’t think Michael would be a good fit for any future promotions.

    Todd Packer is an Outside Sales Rep for the Scranton branch. He is crass, rude and loves to tell inappropriate jokes, so Michael idolizes him for his bold sense of humor. Michael is the only Scranton employee who can stand him.

    In “The Carpet” Michael punishes the whole office when he find that someone treated his office like a toilet, but when it is later revealed that Packer is the culprit, Michael views it as a hilarious prank.

    Packer also has a bit of a problem with booze. In “Sexual Harassment” Todd asks to have someone drive him around due to “the DUI situation.” In “St. Patrick’s Day” he drunkenly calls Michael from a bar. And in “Christmas Party” he passes out while the Scranton employees cover his head with silly string.

    Karen Filippelli transferred to Scranton from the Stamford branch in the Season 3 episode “The Merger.” She begins a relationship with Jim much to the dismay of Pam who also has feelings for him. Pam initially acts cold to Karen because of this but starts to feel sorry for her in “Benihana Christmas” after Angela banishes Karen from the Party Planning Committee.

    Much like Pam, Karen is a target of unwanted attention from the men in the office including Kevin, Michael and Ryan. The end of Season 3 saw the end of her relationship with Karen when Jim dumps her to see if there’s something there with Pam.

    Karen leaves the Scranton branch to become the Regional Manager of the Dunder Mifflin Utica branch where she tries to woo Stanley to come work for her and Michael, Dwight and Jim dress up in disguise to prank her.

    Despite her previous relationship with Jim, she is genuinely happy to hear the he and Pam are engaged and she’s pregnant so it’s clear she’s moved on too. She doesn’t hide her feelings for Michael, however, who she refers to as an idiot in “Branch Wars.”

He is engaged to Pam for four years before he even sets a wedding date so Pam breaks of their engagement in between Season 2 and Season 3.

    Roy suffers a breakdown and hits rock bottom after a DUI arrest. In “Gay Witch Hunt” an emotional Roy vows to win back Pam and at Phillys’ wedding, he pays Kevin’s band to play a favorite song of hers and the two decide to give it another try. They break up for good after Roy finds out Jim kissed Pam though.

    In “The Negotiation” he attempts to attack Jim before Dwight intervenes and later apologizes to Pam and the two part on good terms. He’d run into Jim when he was out with Darryl and some of the warehouse guys after he’s married to Pam but Dwight didn’t need to break up a fight this time.

    Bob Vance owns a refrigeration business in the same office building that Dunder Mifflin occupies. He always introduces himself as “Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration” even when meeting multiple people at one time. This is perhaps trying to use the documentary crew as free advertising for his business. He gets engaged and later marries Phyllis.

    In “Search Committee,” Phyllis reveals that she got Bob to notice her by walking into his office wearing nothing but cat ears for nine days in a row, but on the tenth day she saw Bob waiting for her in nothing but a dog nose. Now that’s love.

    Bob finds Michael annoying and refers to him, Dwight and Andy as jackasses. In “Fun Run” Phyllis mentions that Bob likes to keep things “spicy” and this is shown during a double date with Jim and Pam in “Blood Drive” when the two sneak off to have sex in the restaurant’s bathroom.

    As a business owner, he is very wealthy and even offers to buy a hug Phyllis auctioned off in “Crime Aid” for $1,000.
